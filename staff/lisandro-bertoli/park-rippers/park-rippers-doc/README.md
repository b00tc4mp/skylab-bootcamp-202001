# Park Rippers

## Introduction

Park Rippers is an app that tries to bring some characteristics from the software open source world into the snowboard community. 

The idea is to give the users the posibility of finding snowparks around the world. The parks are added by the users and is the community the one that decides if the park characteristics and location are accurate. When users search for parks they can report the park as being not real, or they can simply propose an eddit for discrepances with the real one. In the case of a park not being real the app will remove it automatically after a certain number of users report it. On the side of eddit proposals is the park uploader the one that needs to take that into consideration and make the change.
