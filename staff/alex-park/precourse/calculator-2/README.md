# Introduction

The current project aims to make a fully-functional calculator, presented with an HTML file and showing off and interaction with a CSS file (in order to add the proper style for said calculator) and a JavaScript file (in order to add the functionality). 

This calculator must make sure that all calculations done work fine, take control of all potential syntax errors, and add a C and AC buttons as well.

## Functional Description

All actions made by the user are taken through the calculator's buttons. This includes buttons for all numbers (0-9), operators (+,-,*,/), AC, C, a button to add decimals and the actual calculator (=). 

Any time the user presses a button, and if possible, will be presented on the main calculation screen, on top.
